I was left holding the financial bag.  My daughter has now struggled with depression and PTSD among other things that eventually led to her abusing drugs to cope with the pain.  I have exhausted the resources for treatment available to us and had to pay for all or part of of treatment she has received over the last couple of years which was an unforseen financial expense, divorce proceedings, and am trying to pay 6200.00 owed to the IRS for $ he removed from a 401K (without my knowledge prior to his incarceration).  I still have debt outstanding to four different medical groups in the amts of 345.00, 650.00, 175.00, and 565.00.  I have been able to eliminate extra expenses related to my daughter that have cost hundreds of dollars, and will continue to find additional ways to cut costs.  The tuition is for the other two children in Catholic school.  I realize this may seem unnecessary, but I have worked very hard to provide a stable, safe, and secure environment for two children who have experienced the unexpected loss of their father and the devastation their older sister's drug addiction has caused.  This is one security I cannot change.  Tuition payments obviously aren't paid in June and July.  Lastly, This year between Jan and May I have an additional 1368.00/mo with the GI Bill as a full-time student.  I will collect that same amount in the fall of 2010 between Sep-Dec. as well.  I haven't had an emergency fund and have been robbing Peter to pay Paul the last few months.  The purpose of the loan is to catch up on monthly expense bills (behind one month on all bills), pay off medical, pay down IRS and decrease Visa (17.4%) in an attempt to increase credit score.  I desperately need to start establishing an emergency fund.  I have anticipated vehicle maintenance costs upcoming as well.  Please let me know if you have additional questions.

Unfortunately the market drop over 30% in the area we lived in and so we did not initially sell and had someone renting.  Recently we listed the house for sale and we are currently in contract.  Therefore the difference in what we owe on our mortgage and what we are getting for the house is the amount listed for this loan.<br/>- The amount we were paying for the mortgage with utilities and condo fees was close to $1400 per month and since this loan will only be $500, we will be able to pay this down fairly quickly.<br/>- My husband also works for Direct Energy as a Pricing Analyst and brings home $55,000 per year.<br/>",other,Columbus,152xx,PA,19.23,0,1,,,11,0,18708,66.8,31,f,2768.93,0,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,157th week,0,,,,1
